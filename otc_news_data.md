# OTC Markets VISM News

Based on the OTC Markets news page, I can see the news items are displayed but there's no obvious embeddable widget or RSS feed available.

## News Items Found:
1. Visium Technologies, Inc. Issues Letter to Shareholders - 10/14/2025
2. Visium Technologies Selected by IREX.AI for Major Public Safety Technology Deployment in Peru - 10/10/2025
3. Visium Technologies and AnyConnect Forge a $60M Digital Infrastructure Framework for Angola - 07/30/2025
4. Visium Technologies Advances to OTCQB Tier on OTC Markets, Demonstrating Growth and Transparency - 06/30/2025

## Implementation Strategy:
Since OTC Markets doesn't provide an embeddable widget, I'll create an iframe embed of the OTC Markets news page directly, which will automatically update as new news is posted.

Alternatively, I can fetch the news page periodically and extract the news items programmatically.
